You only need a portable @code{exe} file to run Jwno, so there isn't really any "installation". These are just recommended steps to get it up and running, plus some things you should know before using it.

### Prerequisites

@ul{
  @li{
    Windows 10/11 (x64)
  }
}

### Downloading

Jwno releases can be found on @link[https://github.com/agent-kilo/jwno/releases]{Github}.

Just grab @code{jwno.exe} and you are good to go. It can be saved to anywhere in your disks. @code{Jwno.exp} and @code{jwno.lib} are for developing native modules, we don't need them just yet.

You may optionally check the checksum of @code{jwno.exe}. For example, calculate it in Powershell:

@codeblock[text]```
$(CertUtil -hashfile path\to\jwno.exe SHA256)[1]
```

And then compare it with the value stored in @code{jwno.exe.sha256}.

### Your First Config File

Jwno needs a config file to work. It's a text file containing some @link[https://janet-lang.org/]{Janet} code, which gets evaluated when you launch Jwno. There are multiple ways to specify a config file:

@ul{
  @li{
    By default, Jwno looks for a file named @code{jwno-config.janet} in the same directory where @code{jwno.exe} resides.
  }
  @li{
    You can drag-n-drop a config file from anywhere to @code{jwno.exe}.
  }
  @li{
    When running Jwno from the command line or a shortcut, pass a path to @code{jwno.exe}: @code```jwno.exe path\to\your\config.janet```
  }
}

Here are some examples:

@ul{
  @li{
    @link[https://github.com/agent-kilo/jwno/blob/master/example/tutorial.janet]{Tutorial.janet} is an interactive tutorial implemented as a single config file. (@link[https://github.com/agent-kilo/jwno/raw/refs/heads/master/example/tutorial.janet]{Download})
  }
  @li{
    @link[https://github.com/agent-kilo/jwno/blob/master/example/example-config.janet]{Example-config.janet} contains some practical config suitable for daily use. (@link[https://github.com/agent-kilo/jwno/raw/refs/heads/master/example/example-config.janet]{Download})
  }
}

To try out either of them, just download the file, then drag-n-drop it to @code{jwno.exe}. I recommend going through the tutorial first, before trying out @code{example-config.janet}. You can build your own config based on @code{example-config.janet} afterwards.

### Automatically Start Jwno When You Log In

A shortcut can be created in the @code{shell:startup} directory to achieve this.

@ol{
  @li{
    Press @code{Win + X} then @code{R} on your keyboard. The @code{Run} dialog should pop up.
  }
  @li{
    Put @code{shell:startup} in the @code{Open:} input box, and press @code{Enter} to confirm.
  }
  @li{
    A File Explorer window will open. Create a shortcut which points to @code{jwno.exe} in that directory.
  }
}
