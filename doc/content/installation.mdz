You only need a portable @code{exe} file to run Jwno, so there isn't really any "installation". These are just recommended steps to get it up and running, plus some things you should know before using it.

### Prerequisites

@ul{
  @li{
    Windows 10/11 (x64)
  }
}

### Downloading

You can find releases and download them from @link[https://github.com/agent-kilo/jwno/releases]{Github}.

Among the downloadable assets, only @code{jwno.exe} is needed for normal usage, and you can place it anywhere in your disks. @code{Jwno.exp} and @code{jwno.lib} are for developing native Jwno modules, see the @link[development.html]{development guide} if you're interested.

It's highly recommended that you also check out @code{jwno.exe.sha256}, and see if the actual checksum of the @code{exe} file matches. A Powershell command can be used to calculate @code{jwno.exe}'s checksum:

@codeblock[text]```
$(CertUtil -hashfile path\to\jwno.exe SHA256)[1]
```

### Your First Config File

You need to specify a config file for Jwno, before it can do anything meaningful. There are multiple ways to do so:

@ul{
  @li{
    By default, Jwno looks for a file named @code{jwno-config.janet} in the directory where @code{jwno.exe} resides.
  }
  @li{
    You can drag-n-drop a config file from anywhere to @code{jwno.exe}.
  }
  @li{
    When running Jwno from the command line or a shortcut, pass a path to @code{jwno.exe}: @code```jwno.exe path\to\your\config.janet```
  }
}

The config file is a text file containing some @link[https://janet-lang.org/]{Janet} code, which gets evaluated when you launch Jwno. Here are some examples:

@ul{
  @li{
    @link[https://github.com/agent-kilo/jwno/blob/master/example/tutorial.janet]{Tutorial.janet} is an interactive tutorial implemented as a single config file. (@link[https://github.com/agent-kilo/jwno/raw/refs/heads/master/example/tutorial.janet]{Download})
  }
  @li{
    @link[https://github.com/agent-kilo/jwno/blob/master/example/example-config.janet]{Example-config.janet} contains some practical config suitable for daily use. (@link[https://github.com/agent-kilo/jwno/raw/refs/heads/master/example/example-config.janet]{Download})
  }
}

You can download either of them, then drag-n-drop it to @code{jwno.exe} to try it out. I recommend going through the tutorial first, before trying out @code{example-config.janet}, and maybe modifying it to build your own config.

### Automatically Start Jwno When You Log In

A shortcut can be created in the @code{shell:startup} directory to achieve this:

@ol{
  @li{
    Press @code{Win + X} then @code{R} on your keyboard. The @code{Run} dialog should pop up.
  }
  @li{
    Put @code{shell:startup} in the @code{Open} input box, and press @code{Enter} to confirm.
  }
  @li{
    A File Explorer window will open. Create a shortcut which points to @code{jwno.exe} in that directory.
  }
}
