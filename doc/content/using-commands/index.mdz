Jwno commands are code actions associated with a name (usually a Janet keyword). They can be bound to a certain key spec, and will be triggered when the corresponding keys are pressed. You can also call them directly in your config file or in the REPL.

Some Commands can accept arguments, but the syntaxes to pass arguments to them differ, depending on how the commands are called.
