Just call the @code{:define-key} method from a keymap object, and pass the command's name with its arguments in a @link[https://janet-lang.org/docs/data_structures/tuples.html]{tuple}:

@codeblock[janet]```
(def keymap (:new-keymap (in jwno/context :key-manager)))  # Create a new keymap
(:define-key keymap "Win + ," [:split-frame :horizontal 2]
             "Split current frame horizontally")
```

Here @code{:split-frame} is the name of our command. @code{:horizontal} and @code{2} are its arguments. If a command takes no argument, you can pass only the name, without putting it in a tuple:

@codeblock[janet]```
(:define-key keymap "Win + Shift + Q" :quit
             "Tell Jwno to exit")
```

The code above is equivalent to:

@codeblock[janet]```
(:define-key keymap "Win + Shift + Q" [:quit]
             "Tell Jwno to exit")
```
