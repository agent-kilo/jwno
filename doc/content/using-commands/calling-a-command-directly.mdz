Note that there's no way to call a Jwno command in the system command line (@code{cmd.exe} or PowerShell) at the moment. This page is about calling a command in your Janet code, or the REPL.

To directly call a command in your Janet code, use the @code{:call-command} method from the command manager object, and pass the command's name and its arguments @em{separately}. Take the @code{:split-frame} command from the previous section as an example again:

@codeblock[janet]```
(:call-command (in jwno/context :command-manager)
               :split-frame :horizontal 2)
```

Comparing to @link[binding-a-command-to-a-key-spec.html]{specifying a command in a @code{:define-key} call}, notice the square brackets around the command name and its arguments are gone. @smaller{This is designed to relieve parenthesis/bracket allergy symptoms for certain users.}
