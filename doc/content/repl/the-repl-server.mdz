Jwno's REPL works in a client-server style, communicating via a TCP socket bound on localhost. A server has to be started before the REPL client can connect to it. You can tell Jwno to automatically start a server in some situations, and the server would bind to @code{127.0.0.1:9999} by default. If the server failed to start automatically, check whether that address is occupied by other programs.
