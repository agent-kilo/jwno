Jwno's documentation can be found in the @code{doc} directory in its source tree. It's written in @link[https://bakpakin.github.io/mendoza/]{Mendoza} markup language. You can read the documentation online @link[https://agent-kilo.github.io/jwno/]{here}, or render and deploy it locally.

@p{@strong{Note: The documentation is work-in-progress. Some pages are missing, because I have not finished writing them yet ðŸ˜…. The released documentation deployed to Github Pages is always for the latest Jwno release.}}

To deploy the docs locally, you need these:

@ul{
  @li{
    Visurl Studio 2022 (The Community version will do.)
  }
  @li{
    Janet (Preferably the latest release version.)
  }
  @li{
    @link[https://github.com/janet-lang/jpm]{JPM}
  }
}

Then, follow these steps:

@ol{
  @li{
    Start an @code{x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2022}.
  }
  @li{
    Run @code{jpm -l install mendoza} in @em{Jwno} source directory.
  }
  @li{
    Run @code{..\\jpm_tree\bin\mdz.bat} in @code{doc} directory.
  }
  @li{
    Check out the built HTML pages in @code{doc\\site} directory.
  }
}

When the documentation source is updated, you only need to repeat step 3 to update the rendered HTML pages.
