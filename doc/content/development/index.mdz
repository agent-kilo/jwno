Congratulations! You endured this boring documentation, and reached the fun part! (Or you skipped it all... a wise choice, I guess?)

Jwno can be extended via pure Janet code, but sometimes that's not enough. Maybe you want to call some native code. Maybe you found a bug in Jwno's core. Or maybe you just want to peek inside. We'll set your dev environment up here, so you can do whatever you want with it.
