### Type

@p{@link[../../using-hooks/filter-hooks.html]{Filter} \(and)}

### Function Signature

@codeblock[janet]```
(hook-fn hwnd uia-win exe-path vd-info)
```

### Description

Used by the scratch pad module, to determine whether a window can be put into the scratch pad. @code{hwnd} is the native handle for the new window. @code{uia-win} is the UI Automation element for the window. @code{exe-path} is the path of the .exe file that created the window. @code{desktop-info} contains the @code{:id} and @code{:name} of the window's virtual desktop.

@p{@code{hook-fn} should return @code{true}, if a window can be put into the scratch pad, or @code{false} otherwise.}

The scratch pad module registers its own @code{:filter-scratch-pad-window} hook function, to filter out unmanageable windows using some pre-defined rules.
