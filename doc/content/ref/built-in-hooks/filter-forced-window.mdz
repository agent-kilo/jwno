### Type

@p{@link[../../using-hooks/filter-hooks.html]{Filter} \(or)}

### Function Signature

@codeblock[janet]```
(hook-fn hwnd uia-win exe-path desktop-info)
```

### Description

Used by the window manager to determine whether a window should be managed forcibly. @code{hwnd} is the native handle for the new window. @code{uia-win} is the UI Automation element for the window. @code{exe-path} is the path of the .exe file that created the window. @code{desktop-info} contains the @code{:id} and @code{:name} of the window's virtual desktop.

@p{@code{hook-fn} should return @code{true}, if a window is to be managed forcibly, or @code{false} otherwise.}

This hook is called before the @code{:filter-window} hook. @code{:filter-window} will be skipped, when this hook returns @code{true}.
