### Type

@p{@link[../../using-hooks/normal-hooks.html]{Normal}}

### Function Signature

@codeblock[janet]```
(hook-fn cur-keymap)
```

### Description

Gets triggered after a @link[../../defining-key-bindings/transient-keymaps.html]{transient keymap} has been popped from the keymap stack by the @code{:pop-keymap} command. @code{cur-keymap} is the new keymap that's currently in effect.

The key manager registers its own @code{:keymap-popped} hook function, for showing keymap hints.
