### Function Signature

@codeblock[janet]```
(hook-fn cmd args)
```

### Description

Used by the command manager to determine whether a command can be executed. @code{cmd} is the command's name, and @code{args} is a tuple containing the command's arguments.

@p{@code{hook-fn} should return @code{true} if the command can be executed, or @code{false} otherwise.}

Special keymap commands, such as @code{:push-keymap} and @code{:pop-keymap}, will not trigger this hook.
