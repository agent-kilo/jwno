### Type

@p{@link[../../using-hooks/normal-hooks.html]{Normal}}

### Function Signature

@codeblock[janet]```
(hook-fn new-layout)
```

### Description

Gets triggered after a new layout object (representing a virtual desktop) has been created. @code{new-layout} is the new layout object.

Note that the window manager only creates a layout object when the first window gets managed on a virtual desktop. If no window is ever opened on a virtual desktop, no layout object for that virtual desktop exists.
