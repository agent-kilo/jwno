### Synopsis

@codeblock[janet]```
(import jwno/layout-history)
```

This module stores your layout history for each virtual desktop, either in memory or in a backing file, and restores them when needed.


### Description

To enable layout history:

@codeblock[janet]```
(def layout-history (layout-history/layout-history jwno/context))
#
# Size limit for the history stack, defaults to 1024 entries
#
(put layout-history :limit 1024)
#
# Where to save the history entries. If it's a relative path, a file
# relative to the user config file would be used. If it's an absolute
# path, a file at the absolute path would be used. If it's nil or not
# set (the default), the history will only be saved in memory.
#
(put layout-history :backing-file "layout-history.jdn")
#
# Engage manual mode or not. In normal (automatic) mode, all layout
# changes will be saved automatically. In manual mode, the current
# layout can be saved by calling the :push-layout-history command.
# Defaults to normal (automatic) mode.
#
(:set-manual layout-history false)
#
# The first "true" argument specifies whether to add layout history
# commands to the command manager. Defaults to true.
#
# The second "true" argument specifies whether to restore the latest
# layouts in the same user session, when enabling layout history. If
# you set this argument to true in your config file, and use a backing
# file, layout-history can restore the last saved layouts when you
# restart Jwno. This argument defaults to false.
#
(:enable layout-history true true)
```

Then, these new commands will be available:

@tag[table]{
  @tr{
    @th{Command} @th{Description}
  }
  @tr{
    @td{@code{:push-layout-history}} @td{Saves the current layout to the history stack. History entries after the current entry will be cleared.}
  }
  @tr{
    @td{@code{:redo-layout-history}} @td{Restores the next layout in the history stack.}
  }
  @tr{
    @td{@code{:undo-layout-history}} @td{Restores the previous layout in the history stack.}
  }
}
