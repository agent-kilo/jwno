### Synopsis

@codeblock[janet]```
(:balance-frames &opt recursive?)
```

### Description

Resizes frames, so that all siblings belonging to the same parent
have the same size. When recursive? is true (the default), resizes
all frames in the current monitor. Otherwise, only resizes the
siblings of the current frame.
