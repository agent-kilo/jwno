### Synopsis

@codeblock[janet]```
(:summon match-fn &opt pull? & cli)
```

### Description

Summons a managed window for which match-fn returns a truthy value.
Match-fn should accept a window object as its sole argument. When
pull? is truthy, and the matching window is on the currently active
virtual desktop, that window will be pulled into the current frame.
Otherwise, simply bring focus to the matching window. If no matching
window is found, will try to execute cli unless its empty.
