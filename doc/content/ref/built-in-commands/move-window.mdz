### Synopsis

@codeblock[janet]```
(:move-window dir)
```

### Description

Moves a window in the specified direction. Dir can be :left,
:right, :up, :down, or a tuple in the form of [dx dy].

When dir is a direction keyword, the window is moved between
adjacent frames.

When dir is a tuple, the window is moved freely, unconstrained
by frames. Dx and dy are distances (in physical pixels) to move
the window on the horizontal and vertical axes, respectively.
