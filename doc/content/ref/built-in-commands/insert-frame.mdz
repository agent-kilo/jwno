### Synopsis

@codeblock[janet]```
(:insert-frame location &opt after-insertion-fn direction depth)
```

### Description

Inserts a new frame and adjusts its sibling or parent frames' sizes
as needed.

Location is relative to the current frame in the level specified by
depth, can be :before or :after.

After-insertion-fn is a function accepting the new inserted frame
object as its sole argument, and it will be called after the
insertion.

Direction is the direction to insert the new frame in. Can be
:horizontal or :vertical. Uses the parent frame's current direction
if not provided.

Depth specifies in which level the new frame should be inserted, and
1 means to insert a child frame to the current top-level frame.
Defaults to the depth of the current frame.
