### Synopsis

@codeblock[janet]```
(:insert-frame location &opt after-insertion-fn)
```

### Description

Inserts a new frame and adjusts its sibling frames' sizes as needed.
Location is relative to the current frame, can be :before or :after.
After-insertion-fn is a function accepting the new inserted frame
object as its sole argument, and it will be called after the insertion.
If the current frame is a top-level frame, this command does nothing.
