### Synopsis

@codeblock[janet]```
(:insert-frame location &opt after-insertion-fn depth)
```

### Description

Inserts a new frame and adjusts its sibling frames' sizes as needed.
Location is relative to the current frame in the level specified by
depth, can be :before or :after. After-insertion-fn is a function
accepting the new inserted frame object as its sole argument, and it
will be called after the insertion. Depth specifies in which level
the new frame should be inserted, and 1 means to insert a child frame
to the current top-level frame.
