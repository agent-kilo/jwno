### Synopsis

@codeblock[janet]```
(:split-frame dir &opt nfr ratios after-split-fn)
```

### Description

Divides a frame into multiple sub-frames. Dir can be :vertical or
:horizontal. Nfr specifies the number of sub-frames which defaults
to 2. Ratios, if provided, should be a tuple or array, containing
ratios for sub-frame sizes. After-split-fn is a function accepting
the frame object being divided as its sole argument, and it will
be called after the split.

For example, calling the command (:split-frame :vertical 3 [0.1 0.3 0.6])
splits the current frame into 3 vertical sub-frames, whose heights
are 0.1, 0.3 and 0.6 of the original frame height, respectively.
