### Synopsis

@codeblock[janet]```
(:scroll-parent distance &opt depth)
```

### Description

Scrolls an unconstained parent frame by the amount specified by
distance (in pixels). Use a positive distance to scroll forward,
or a negative distance to scroll backward.

Depth specifies which level of frames should be affected. 1 means
to scroll top-level frames, and 2 means to scroll children of
top-level frames, etc. Defaults to the parent of the current active
leaf frame.

Does nothing if the parent frame is constrained.
