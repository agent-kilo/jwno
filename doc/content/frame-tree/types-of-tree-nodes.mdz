There are currently four types of nodes in the frame tree. You can check the @code{:type} property of a node to determine its type:

@codeblock[janet]```
(case (in node :type)
  # A managed window, which has no children
  :window
  ...

  # A frame, which contains windows or other frames
  :frame
  ...

  # A virtual desktop, which contains top-level frames (monitors)
  :layout
  ...

  # The root of the frame tree, which contains layouts (virtual desktops)
  :virtual-desktop-container
  ...
  )
```

There's no monitor type though. In Jwno, a monitor is just a special @code{:frame}, called a @em{top-level} frame. You can check a frame node's @code{:monitor} property to see if it's a monitor:

@codeblock[janet]```
(if-let [monitor (in node :monitor)]
  (do
    # It's a monitor
    )
  (do
    # It's a normal frame otherwise
    )
  )
```

For all types of tree nodes, their supported methods can be inspected by peeking inside their prototypes:

@codeblock[janet]```
(keys (table/proto-flatten node))
```
