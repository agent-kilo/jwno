Most built-in hooks in Jwno are normal hooks. They are used solely for their side effects, and their return values are ignored. The @code{:window-created} hook we saw above is a normal hook.

You can define and call a custom normal hook like this:

@codeblock[janet]```
(:call-hook (in jwno/context :hook-manager) :world-dominated galaxy system planet)
```

So here we have a custom hook called @code{:world-dominated}, and its registered functions should accept three arguments, @code{galaxy}, @code{system} and @code{planet}, pointing out the specific planet we just conquered.
