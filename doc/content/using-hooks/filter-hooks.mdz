In contrast to normal hooks, filter hooks are used mainly for getting their return values, i.e. the filter results, which are usually @code{true} or @code{false}. You may also utilize side effects in functions registered under filter hooks, but that's not always reliable, since filter hooks can get @em{short circuited}, and some of its functions may not always get executed.

There are again two types of filter hooks: the @em{and} hooks and the @em{or} hooks. Just as their names suggest, they work like @code{and} and @code{or} functions respectively.

@p{@em{And} hooks call their registered functions consecutively, until one of them returns @code{false}, or until all the functions are called.}

To define and call a custom @em{and} filter hook:

@codeblock[janet]```
(def result
  (:call-filter-hook (in self :hook-manager) :and :filter-habitable-planet
                     galaxy system planet))
```

We have @code{:filter-habitable-planet} as the name of our new hook, and @code{galaxy}, @code{system}, @code{planet} will be passed to its registered functions as arguments.

Similarly, @em{or} hooks call their registered functions consecutively, until one of them returns @code{true}, or until all the functions are called.

To define and call a custom @em{or} filter hook:

@codeblock[janet]```
(def result
  (:call-filter-hook (in self :hook-manager) :or :filter-forbidden-planet
                     galaxy system planet))
```
