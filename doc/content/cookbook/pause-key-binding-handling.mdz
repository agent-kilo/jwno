Every key that's not defined in a keymap gets passed through verbatim, so you can use an empty @link[../defining-key-bindings/transient-keymaps.html]{transient keymap} to implement a "passthrough" mode:

@codeblock[janet]```
(def passthrough-mode-keymap (:new-keymap (in jwno/context :key-manager)))
(:define-key passthrough-mode-keymap
             "Win + Ctrl + Alt + P"
             :pop-keymap
             "Exit passthrough mode")

(:define-key root-keymap
             "Win + Ctrl + Alt + P"
             [:push-keymap passthrough-mode-keymap]
             "Passthrough mode")
(:set-keymap (in jwno/context :key-manager) root-keymap)
```

While this passthrough mode is active, every key except @code{Win + Ctrl + Alt + P} gets passed through, until you press @code{Win + Ctrl + Alt + P} again.

Or, if you only need a @em{one-shot} passthrough key, use an empty @link[../defining-key-bindings/multi-level-keymaps.html]{mulpi-level keymap} instead:

@codeblock[janet]```
(:define-key root-keymap
             "Win + Ctrl + Shift + P  Enter"
             :nop
             "Cancel")
```

Any key following @code{Win + Ctrl + Shift + P}, except @code{Enter}, gets passed through, then Jwno automatically resets itself to the root keymap. You can press @code{Enter} midway to cancel this "one-shot passthrough " operation.
