Use the @code{:filter-forced-window} hook for this:

@codeblock[janet]```
(:add-hook (in jwno/context :hook-manager) :filter-forced-window
   (fn [_hwnd _uia exe _desktop]
     (string/has-suffix? "\\SomeNaughtyExecutable.exe" exe)))
```

Here we are checking a window's exe file path, to see if we should force it.

To determine if a window is suitable for forced management, you can invoke the @code{:manage-window} command on it, and see how it reacts. This command is bound to @code{Win + W  M} or @code{Alt + W  M} in the example config.

The @code{:filter-forced-window} hook will override the @code{:filter-window} hook.
