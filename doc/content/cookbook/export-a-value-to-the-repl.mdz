The whole config file environment can now be accessed via the @code{jwno/user-config} variable in the REPL. Alternatively, you can do @code{(import jwno/user-config)} to import your config file as a module.

But if you want to export something defined in your config file @em{explicitly} to the REPL, you can do it in you config:

@codeblock[janet]```
(import jwno/util)
(def repl-server
  (or (:get-default-server (in jwno/context :repl-manager))
      (:start-server (in jwno/context :repl-manager))))
(util/export-to-repl repl-server my-awesome-stuff)
```

This will automatically start an REPL server if no server is already running, and export the value @code{my-awesome-stuff}.
