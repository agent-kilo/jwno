Right-clicking on the notification area icon @html```<img style="height: 1em; width: 1em;" alt="Jwno Logo" src="../img/jwno.png">``` will bring up a menu with several commands:

@tag[table]{
  @tr{
    @th{Item} @th{Description}
  }
  @tr{
    @td{@em{Jwno <version>}} @td{Shows the versions of Janet and Jwno itself.}
  }
  @tr{
    @td{@em{Launch REPL}} @td{Opens the REPL window.}
  }
  @tr{
    @td{@em{Update Monitor Layout}} @td{Normally Jwno will adjust to monitor layout changes automatically, but you can use this command to do that manually. It will also retile all managed windows.}
  }
  @tr{
    @td{@em{Reset Keyboard Hooks}} @td{Sometimes Jwno's keyboard hooks (which are needed for global key bindings to work) may get overridden by other programs, and this command is to fix that.}
  }
  @tr{
    @td{@em{Exit}} @td{Tells Jwno to quit.}
  }
}
