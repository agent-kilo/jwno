Right-clicking on the notification area icon @html```<img style="height: 1em; width: 1em;" alt="Jwno Logo" src="../img/jwno.png">``` will bring up a menu with several commands:

@ul{
  @li{
    @em{Jwno <version>}: Shows the versions of Janet and Jwno itself.
  }
  @li{
    @em{Launch REPL}: Opens the REPL window.
  }
  @li{
    @em{Update Monitor Layout}: Normally Jwno will adjust to monitor layout changes automatically, but you can use this command to do that manually. It will also retile all managed windows.
  }
  @li{
    @em{Reset Keyboard Hooks}: Sometimes Jwno's keyboard hooks (which are needed for global key bindings to work) may get overridden by other programs, and this command is to fix that.
  }
  @li{
    @em{Exit}: Tells Jwno to quit.
  }
}
