Jwno needs a config file to work. It's a text file containing some @link[https://janet-lang.org/]{Janet} code, which gets evaluated when you launch Jwno. There are multiple ways to specify a config file:

@ul{
  @li{
    By default, Jwno looks for a file named @code{jwno-config.janet} in the same directory where @code{jwno.exe} resides.
  }
  @li{
    You can drag-n-drop a config file from anywhere to @code{jwno.exe}.
  }
  @li{
    When running Jwno from the command line or a shortcut, pass a path to @code{jwno.exe}: @code```jwno.exe path\to\your\config.janet```
  }
}

Here are some examples:

@ul{
  @li{
    @link[https://github.com/agent-kilo/jwno/blob/master/example/tutorial.janet]{Tutorial.janet} is an interactive tutorial implemented as a single config file. (@link[https://github.com/agent-kilo/jwno/raw/refs/heads/master/example/tutorial.janet]{Download})
  }
  @li{
    @link[https://github.com/agent-kilo/jwno/blob/master/example/example-config.janet]{Example-config.janet} contains some practical config suitable for daily use. (@link[https://github.com/agent-kilo/jwno/raw/refs/heads/master/example/example-config.janet]{Download})
  }
}

To try out either of them, just download the file, then drag-n-drop it to @code{jwno.exe}. I recommend going through the tutorial first, before trying out @code{example-config.janet}. You can build your own config based on @code{example-config.janet} afterwards.
