Once launched, Jwno will start to tile new windows. Existing windows will get tiled @em{when they get focus}. An icon @html```<img style="height: 1em; width: 1em;" alt="Jwno Logo" src="../img/jwno.png">``` will be shown in the notification area (a.k.a. system tray) on the taskbar when Jwno is running. If you're using @code{example-config.janet} mentioned in the previous section, you can also press @code{Win + Shift + /} \(the slash key) or @code{Alt + Shift + /} to show all key bindings defined in Jwno.
