You can download Jwno executable files from @link[https://github.com/agent-kilo/jwno/releases]{Github}, or purchase it from @link[https://agentkilo.itch.io/jwno]{itch.io}. You get the exact same executable files either way.

Just grab @code{jwno.exe} and you are good to go. It can be saved to anywhere in your disks. @code{Jwno.exp} and @code{jwno.lib} are for developing native modules, we don't need them just yet.

You may optionally check the checksum of @code{jwno.exe}. For example, calculate it in Powershell:

@codeblock[text]```
$(CertUtil -hashfile path\to\jwno.exe SHA256)[1]
```

And then compare it with the value stored in @code{jwno.exe.sha256}.
