One of the most powerful features from Jwno's key binding system is that, you can specify multiple key combos in a sequence, and it will automatically define @em{multi-level} keymaps for you (akin to @link[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Changing-Key-Bindings.html]{Emacs key bindings}):

@codeblock[janet]```
"Win + Enter  Ctrl + A  B"
```

This means @em{press and release @code{Win + Enter} first, then press and release @code{Ctrl + A}, and finally just tap the @code{B} key}. You can use any keys @link[../ref/key-names.html]{recognizable by Jwno} in any level of the keymaps, including all the modifiers.

A typical use case for multi-level keymaps is to group similar commands together, and give them the same "prefix". For example, in the @link[https://github.com/agent-kilo/jwno/blob/master/example/example-config.janet]{example config}, all the infrequently used window commands begin with @code{Win + W}.
