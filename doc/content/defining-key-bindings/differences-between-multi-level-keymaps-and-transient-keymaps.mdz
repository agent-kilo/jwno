Well, they both look like some "namespacing" mechanism, in that you can enable the next level of key bindings by pressing a certain key combo. But multi-level keymaps will always @em{reset to the root keymap immediately} after a command is triggered or an undefined key is pressed, while transient keymaps will @em{stick around} until you pop it from the stack.

Yeah, seriously, transient keymaps stick around. You should know by now how bad I am at naming things.
