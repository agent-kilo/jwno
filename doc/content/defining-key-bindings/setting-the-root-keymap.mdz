We call the keymap where your top-level key bindings are defined the @em{root keymap}. You can invoke those key bindings directly, without any prefix. For example, to make @code{awesome-keymap} your root keymap:

@codeblock[janet]```
(:set-keymap (in jwno/context :key-manager) awesome-keymap)
```

Modifications to keymaps @em{will not take effect} before the @code{:set-keymap} method is called again, e.g.:

@codeblock[janet]```
(:set-keymap (in jwno/context :key-manager) awesome-keymap)

# We defined a new key binding after calling `:set-keymap`:
(:define-key awesome-keymap "Win + Ctrl + Shift + Alt + B" :brew-coffee)

# But it won't work until we properly set the keymap again:
(:set-keymap (in jwno/context :key-manager) awesome-keymap)
```

Jwno has no default key bindings, so you have to call the @code{:set-keymap} method with the keymap you defined, or it won't respond to any key events.
