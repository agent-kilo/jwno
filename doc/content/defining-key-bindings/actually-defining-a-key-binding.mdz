To associate a key spec with a command to execute, call the @code{:define-key} method from a keymap object, and you can optionally write some description:

@codeblock[janet]```
(def keymap (:new-keymap (in jwno/context :key-manager)))  # Create a new keymap
(:define-key keymap "Win + Shift + Q" :quit
             "Tell Jwno to exit")
(:define-key keymap "Win + W  D" :describe-window
             "Show some info about the current window")
```
