Jwno is still in active development, but it already has many desirable features.

#### 🪶 Super lightweight.

Please, go to the @link[https://github.com/agent-kilo/jwno/releases]{download page} and checkout the file size. Maybe click on the download link too 😎.

#### 🤗 Non-intrusive.

Jwno only changes the layout or moves your windows when you tell it to.

#### 🖥️ Native virtual desktops.

It's designed to work with native Windows @link[https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/multiple-desktops-in-windows-36f52e38-5b4a-557b-2ff9-e1a60c976434]{virtual desktops}.

#### 👾 Hackable REPL.

Like most Lisp systems, Jwno has REPL support. That means you can hack it while it's still running 🤘.

<div class="twelve columns">
```

#### 🪄 Highly customizable.

You can call native Win32 APIs in user scripts/plugins to implement your own features. For example, to move a window using the low-level @link[https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-setwindowpos]{SetWindowPos} function:

@codeblock[janet]```
(use jw32/_winuser)
(SetWindowPos hwnd nil 100 100 500 500 (bor SWP_NOZORDER))
```

@html```

```

@html```
<div class="row feature-list">

<div class="twelve columns">
```

#### ⌨️ Powerful key binding system.

It supports multi-level and transient keymaps. For example, this defines a multi-level keymap:

@codeblock[janet]```
(:define-key keymap "Win + Enter  A" :command1)
(:define-key keymap "Win + Enter  B" :command2)
```

To run @code{:command1}, one should press @code{Win + Enter}, and then the @code{A} key. To run @code{:command2}, press @code{Win + Enter} followed by @code{B} key instead. The code above essentially "groups" @code{:command1} and @code{:command2} under @code{Win + Enter}.
