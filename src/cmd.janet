  (:add-command command-man :nop cmd-nop
     ```
     (:nop)

     Does nothing. When you want to return from a sub-keymap, without
     executing any actual commands, map a key to call this command, and
     it'll act as a "cancel" key.
     ```)
  (:add-command command-man :quit
     (fn [] (cmd-quit ui-man))
     ```
     (:quit)

     Tells Jwno to stop running.
     ```)
  (:add-command command-man :retile
     (fn [] (cmd-retile wm))
     ```
     (:retile)

     Fits all managed windows to their frames.
     ```)

  (:add-command command-man :exec
     (fn [verbose? & cli]
       (cmd-exec wm ui-man verbose? cli))

     (:exec & cli)

     Executes a command line specified by cli.

  (:add-command command-man :summon
     (fn [match-fn &opt pull? & cli]
       (cmd-summon wm ui-man match-fn pull? cli))
     ```
     (:summon match-fn &opt pull? & cli)

     Summons a managed window for which match-fn returns a truthy value.
     Match-fn should accept a window object as its sole argument. When
     pull? is truthy, and the matching window is on the currently active
     virtual desktop, that window will be pulled into the current frame.
     Otherwise, simply bring focus to the matching window. If no matching
     window is found, will try to execute cli unless its empty.
     ```)
  (:add-command command-man :repl
     (fn [&opt start? host port]
       (cmd-repl context start? host port))
     ```
     (:repl &opt start? host port)

     Opens an REPL window for the current Jwno process. If start? is
     truthy, and no REPL server is available, a new server will be
     started. Host and port specify the address to connect, and they
     default to "127.0.0.1" and 9999.
     ```)

  (:add-command command-man :split-frame
     (fn [dir &opt nfr ratios after-split-fn]
       (cmd-split-frame wm dir nfr ratios after-split-fn))
     ```
     (:split-frame dir &opt nfr ratios after-split-fn)

     Divides a frame into multiple sub-frames. Dir can be :vertical or
     :horizontal. Nfr specifies the number of sub-frames which defaults
     to 2. Ratios, if provided, should be a tuple or array, containing
     ratios for sub-frame sizes. After-split-fn is a function accepting
     the frame object being divided as its sole argument, and it will
     be called after the split.

     For example, calling the command (:split-frame :vertical 3 [0.1 0.3 0.6])
     splits the current frame into 3 vertical sub-frames, whose heights
     are 0.1, 0.3 and 0.6 of the original frame height, respectively.
     ```)
  (:add-command command-man :insert-frame
     (fn [location &opt after-insertion-fn direction depth]
       (cmd-insert-frame wm location after-insertion-fn direction depth))
     ```
     (:insert-frame location &opt after-insertion-fn direction depth)

     Inserts a new frame and adjusts its sibling or parent frames' sizes
     as needed.

     Location is relative to the current frame in the level specified by
     depth, can be :before or :after.

     After-insertion-fn is a function accepting the new inserted frame
     object as its sole argument, and it will be called after the
     insertion.

     Direction is the direction to insert the new frame in. Can be
     :horizontal or :vertical. Uses the parent frame's current direction
     if not provided.

     Depth specifies in which level the new frame should be inserted, and
     1 means to insert a child frame to the current top-level frame.
     Defaults to the depth of the current frame.
     ```)
  (:add-command command-man :flatten-parent
     (fn [] (cmd-flatten-parent wm))
     ```
     (:flatten-parent)

     Flattens the parent frame, by closing the current frame and all
     its siblings.
     ```)

  (:add-command command-man :resize-frame
     (fn [dw dh] (cmd-resize-frame wm dw dh))
     ```
     (:resize-frame dw dh)

     Resizes the current frame. Dw and dh are the deltas of width and
     height, respectively. Both of them are in physical pixels.

     Note that this command also resizes all windows contained in the
     frame. To resize a single window, use the :resize-window command.
     ```)
  (:add-command command-man :close-frame
     (fn [] (cmd-close-frame wm))
     ```
     (:close-frame)

     Closes the current frame.
     ```)
  (:add-command command-man :frame-to-window-size
     (fn [] (cmd-frame-to-window-size wm))
     ```
     (:frame-to-window-size)

     Resizes the current frame, so that it's the same size as its
     current active window. Constraints from the parent frame apply.
     ```)
  (:add-command command-man :balance-frames
     (fn [&opt recursive?] (cmd-balance-frames wm recursive?))
     ```
     (:balance-frames &opt recursive?)

     Resizes frames, so that all siblings belonging to the same parent
     have the same size. When recursive? is true (the default), resizes
     all frames in the current monitor. Otherwise, only resizes the
     siblings of the current frame.
     ```)
  (:add-command command-man :rotate-sibling-frames
     (fn [&opt dir steps depth] (cmd-rotate-sibling-frames wm dir steps depth))
     ```
     (:rotate-sibling-frames &opt dir steps depth)

     Rotates sibling frames.

     When dir is :forward, the first frame will be moved to the end
     of the frame list. When dir is :backward, the last frame will be
     moved to the beginning of the frame list instead. Defaults to
     :forward.

     Steps specifies how many times the frame list should be rotated.
     Defaults to 1.

     Depth specifies which level of frames should be rotated. 0 means
     to rotate top-level frames, 1 means to rotate children of top-level
     frames, etc. Defaults to the level of the current active leaf
     frame.
     ```)
  (:add-command command-man :reverse-sibling-frames
     (fn [&opt depth] (cmd-reverse-sibling-frames wm depth))
     ```
     (:reverse-sibling-frames &opt depth)

     Reverses the order of sibling frames.

     Depth specifies which level of frames should be reversed. 0 means
     to reverse top-level frames, 1 means to reverse children of top-level
     frames, etc. Defaults to the level of the current active leaf
     frame.
     ```)
  (:add-command command-man :toggle-parent-direction
     (fn [&opt recursive depth] (cmd-toggle-parent-direction wm recursive depth))
     ```
     (:toggle-parent-direction &opt recursive depth)

     Changes the direction of the parent frame. If the direction was
     :horizontal, it becomes :vertical, and vice versa.

     Depth specifies which level of frame's direction should be toggled.
     1 means to toggle top-level frames, 2 means to toggle children of
     top-level frames, etc. Defaults to the parent of the current active
     leaf frame.
     ```)
  (:add-command command-man :toggle-parent-viewport
     (fn [&opt depth] (cmd-toggle-parent-viewport wm depth))
     ```
     (:toggle-parent-viewport &opt depth)

     Enable or disable viewport for a parent frame. The parent frame
     becomes unconstrained when its viewport is enabled.

     Depth specifies which level of frame's viewport should be toggled.
     1 means to toggle top-level frames, 2 means to toggle children of
     top-level frames, etc. Defaults to the parent of the current active
     leaf frame.
     ```)
  (:add-command command-man :zoom-in
     (fn [ratio] (cmd-zoom-in wm ratio))
     ```
     (:zoom-in ratio)

     Resizes the current frame, so that its size is proportional to
     its ancestors', according to ratio.

     For example, (:zoom-in 0.7) makes a frame to have 0.7 of both
     its ancestors' width and height.
     ```)

  (:add-command command-man :enum-frame
     (fn [dir] (cmd-enum-frame wm dir))
     ```
     (:enum-frame dir)

     Brings focus to another frame in the specified direction. Dir
     can be :next or :prev.
     ```)
  (:add-command command-man :adjacent-frame
     (fn [dir] (cmd-adjacent-frame wm dir))
     ```
     (:adjacent-frame dir)

     Brings focus to the adjacent frame in the specified direction.
     Dir can be :left, :right, :up or :down.
     ```)

  (:add-command command-man :enum-window-in-frame
     (fn [dir] (cmd-enum-window-in-frame wm dir))
     ```
     (:enum-window-in-frame dir)

     Brings focus to another window in the current frame, in the
     specified direction. Dir can be :next or :prev.
     ```)
  (:add-command command-man :cascade-windows-in-frame
     (fn [&opt dx dy] (cmd-cascade-windows-in-frame wm dx dy))
     ```
     (:cascade-windows-in-frame &opt dx dy)

     Cascades windows in the current frame. Dx and dy are the X and
     Y offsets for each window, respectively. Dx and dy are both in
     virtual pixels, and default to 32.
     ```)

  (:add-command command-man :move-window
     (fn [dir] (cmd-move-window wm dir))
     ```
     (:move-window dir)

     Moves a window in the specified direction. Dir can be :left,
     :right, :up, :down, or a tuple in the form of [dx dy].

     When dir is a direction keyword, the window is moved between
     adjacent frames.

     When dir is a tuple, the window is moved freely, unconstrained
     by frames. Dx and dy are distances (in physical pixels) to move
     the window on the horizontal and vertical axes, respectively.
     ```)
  (:add-command command-man :resize-window
     (fn [dw dh] (cmd-resize-window wm dw dh))
     ```
     (:resize-window dw dh)

     Resizes the focused window. Dw and dh are the deltas of width
     and height, respectively. Both of them are in physical pixels.

     Note that this command resizes a single window. To resize all
     windows contained in a frame, use the :resize-frame command.
     ```)
  (:add-command command-man :close-window
     (fn [] (cmd-close-window wm ui-man))
     ```
     (:close-window)

     Tries to close the focused window. This command works by
     sending a message to the target window, instead of forcibly
     killing the window's process.
     ```)
  (:add-command command-man :change-window-alpha
     (fn [delta] (cmd-change-window-alpha wm delta))
     ```
     (:change-window-alpha delta)

     Changes the focused window's alpha value, making it partially
     transparent. Delta, which can be negative, is the increment to
     apply to the alpha value. A window's alpha value is in the
     range [0, 255]. Some window's alpha cannot be changed.
     ```)

  (:add-command command-man :close-window-or-frame
     (fn [] (cmd-close-window-or-frame wm ui-man))
     ```
     (:close-window-or-frame)

     If the current frame is not empty, closes its active window.
     Otherwise, closes the current frame.
     ```)

  (:add-command command-man :describe-window
     (fn [] (cmd-describe-window wm ui-man))
     ```
     (:describe-window)

     Shows basic info about a window.
     ```)

  (:add-command command-man :manage-window
     (fn [] (cmd-manage-window wm ui-man))
     ```
     (:manage-window)

     Forcibly adds the current window to the list of managed windows.
     ```)

  (:add-command command-man :toggle-window-management
     (fn [] (cmd-toggle-window-management hook-man ui-man))
     ```
     (:toggle-window-management)

     Pauses/unpauses window management. Will not affect windows that
     are already managed.
     ``` )

  (:add-command command-man :ignore-window
     (fn [] (cmd-ignore-window wm ui-man))
     ```
     (:ignore-window)

     Removes the current window from the list of managed windows.
     ```)

  (:add-command command-man :describe-key
     (fn [] (cmd-describe-key context))
     ```
     (:describe-key)

     Interactively reads a key, and shows some info about it.
     ```)
